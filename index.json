Code Migration I use Intellij to migrate the code.\n Go to Refactor \u0026gt; Migrate packages and classes \u0026gt; Junit (4.x -\u0026gt; 5.x) Try to compile your code to see if all import were correctly replaced If it compiles ok, you have the basic migration done. In most of the cases we need to rewrite some tests.  3. Upgrading the tests 3.1 @Test(expected=\u0026hellip;) Junit 5 has a more elegant way of testing expected exceptions. If you have\n@Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class) public void testIfExceptionIsThrown() throws Exception { prepareMethod(); methodCall(); } you need to migrate to\n@Test void testIfExceptionIsThrown() { prepareMethod(); assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -\u0026gt; methodCall()); } 3.2 @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) If you have\n@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) public class MyClassTest { you need to migrate to the ExtendWith and add a new dependency of Mockito.\nCheck the latest version at https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-junit-jupiter.\nNew dependency:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.mockito\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;mockito-junit-jupiter\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;4.6.1\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;scope\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/scope\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; And then the new ExtendWith:\n@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) public class MyClassTest { 3.3 Replace imports Sometimes the migration fails to replace all imports. Do it manually\n   Old import New import     import static org.mockito.Matchers.any; import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.any;   import static org.junit.Assert. import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.    3.4 Unnecessary stubbings detected. New Mockito versions are more strict about unnecessary stubbing and they want you to use strict stubbing. If you do not want to touch your tests yet to make them more strict, you will need to add another annotation to your class or add lenient to your mock.\nClass configuration Add @MockitoSettings(strictness = Strictness.LENIENT)\n@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) @MockitoSettings(strictness = Strictness.LENIENT) public class MyClassTest { Test configuration Add lenient() in front of each failed stubbing:\nlenient().when(mock.getName()).thenReturn(name); 3.5 Parametrized tests In Junit5 the parametrized tests were redesigned.

A Maven archetype is a templated project. Maven offers several archetypes that allow you to create new maven modules ready to run in few seconds.\nHow to use a generic archetype? Archetype usage is quite simple. If you want to generate an archetype based on the default list, just run:\nmvn archetype:generate And then choose one of the options, provide the details and confirm. The new project will be already created.\nHow to use a custom archetype? In this case, we need to specify the groupId and artifactId of the archetype to be able to use a custom one. As an example, let\u0026rsquo;s see the archetype provided by Adobe for AEM:\nmvn archetype:generate \\ -DarchetypeGroupId=com.adobe.aem \\ -D archetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype \\ -D archetypeVersion=27 If you run the command, you will be asked about some properties of your project. Some properties are standard (groupId, version, artifactId and package), but others were specific of this artifact, like appTitle or sdkVersion. These properties will help the archetype to generate a new project for you and in few seconds and knowing nothing about Adobe AEM you have your new project ready to run.\nHow does the archetype work? Internally, an archetype has all the files (pom file, classes, readme, etc\u0026hellip;) with variables that will be replaced during project generation. As an example, you can see these variables in several parts of the pom file below.\n\u0026lt;project xmlns=\u0026#34;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\u0026#34; xmlns:xsi=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\u0026#34; xsi:schemaLocation=\u0026#34;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;modelVersion\u0026gt;4.0.0\u0026lt;/modelVersion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;${groupId}\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;${rootArtifactId}\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;${version}\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;relativePath\u0026gt;../pom.xml\u0026lt;/relativePath\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;${artifactId}\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;${appTitle} - Core\u0026lt;/name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;Core bundle for ${appTitle}\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; ... Example extracted from Github adobe/aem-project-archetype project\nMaven has a good documentation how to organize and create your archetype from scratch.\nCreating an archetype from a project In most cases, it is hard to maintain an archetype because:\n It is not a project itself, so you need to use your archetype to see if the generated project is working. Templating is good, but it is hard to read and you need to \u0026ldquo;imagine\u0026rdquo; how the code will look like after. We are lazy, and if it is hard to understand, it will be hard to maintain. People will go back to copy-paste projects and replace the text.  A simple way to bypass all these constraints is to create an archetype from an example project. Our example project is a perfect compilable project with all desired configurations we want to keep together in the clones.\nCreate your archetype example project Some characteristics are desired in the archetype example project:\n It should be simple, but complete. Remember to include all dependencies and one example of each element of your project. For example, if the project is a microservice, it makes sense to include a controller, a service, and a repository. Name it in a coherent manner (you will see it in the next steps). I would recommend, for example, having a controller called ArchetypeExampleController which talks to ArchetypeExampleService. In each file, place the same prefix in the variables, so it will be easy to replace them. For example, if you need a variable for your ArchetypeExampleService, a good name is archetypeVariableService. Include the dotfiles as part of this project and a good readme.  archetype:create-from-project The maven goal archetype:create-from-project is the key to generate an archetype from a project.\nAs part of the configuration, you can pass an archetype.properties file as a parameter. This property file should like that:\n# these are standard properties package=com.almeida.tomas groupId=archetype.it artifactId=basic version=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT # here we add our personalized properties defaultClassPrefix=ArchetypeExample defaultVariablePrefix=archetypeVariable As you see above, I only included the changing part of the files or variables and maven will take care of replacing them for me.\nStep-by-step Let\u0026rsquo;s go through all the steps from our archetype example project until our archetype.\n1. Rename all dotfiles It was a known issue that dotfiles are not included in the archetype. So we need to rename them, so they will be also included in the generated archetype (and posterior project).\nmv .gitignore dot.gitignore mv .file dot.file 2. Call the maven goal with the desired parameters. mvn -U clean archetype:create-from-project \\  -Dinteractive=false \\  -DkeepParent=true \\  -DpropertyFile=archetype.properties \\  -DpackageName=com.almeida.tomas \\  -Darchetype.filteredExtensions=java,xml,md In the documentation, you can see more parameters and why and when they are used, but in summary:\n -Dinteractive=false: interactive mode is disabled. -DkeepParent=true: keep the parent. -DpropertyFile=archetype.properties: use our archetype.properties file to check for the variables. -DpackageName=com.almeida.tomas: the package name for java sources that should be included in the archetype. -Darchetype.filteredExtensions=java,xml,md: files with the selected extensions will be checked and the content and the name of the files will be changed by the variables.  3. Clean up the generated archetype metadata In some cases, the generation includes a default value of a property and we want to be sure that all values will be filled by the user.\ncd target/generated-sources/archetype/ sed -i 's/.*defaultValue.*//g' src/main/resources/META-INF/maven/archetype-metadata.xml 4. Install or deploy the archetype If you are running these commands locally install, the archetype in your local repo:\n# be sure to be in the target/generated-sources/archetype folder mvn -B -U clean install My recommendation is to configure a Jenkins job, so every time a change is pushed to the project, Jenkins runs the commands and pushes a new version to your repository.\n# deploy the archetype to repository mvn -B -U clean deploy Use your created archetype The created archetype will have the same artifactId with a -archetype suffix. So based on our example:\nmvn archetype:generate \\  -DarchetypeGroupId=tomas.examples \\  -DarchetypeArtifactId=archetypeProject-archetype \\  -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT Now, we will be asked to provide a value to the default and personalized variables:\nDefine value for property \u0026#39;groupId\u0026#39;: com.tomas.almeida Define value for property \u0026#39;artifactId\u0026#39;: demo-project Define value for property \u0026#39;version\u0026#39; 1.0-SNAPSHOT: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT Define value for property \u0026#39;package\u0026#39; com.tomas.almeida: com.tomas.almeida.domain Define value for property \u0026#39;defaultClassPrefix\u0026#39;: Demo Define value for property \u0026#39;defaultVariablePrefix\u0026#39;: demo Confirm the values you have entered are correct:\nConfirm properties configuration: groupId: com.tomas.almeida artifactId: demo-project version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT package: com.tomas.almeida.domain defaultClassPrefix: Demo defaultVariablePrefix: demo Y: : Y A new folder will be created and the name is the artifacId name. In our example, demo-project.\ncd demo-project The dotfiles need to be renamed:\nmv dot.gitignore .gitignore mv dot.file .file So, you can now create several clones of your archetype example project in minutes!\n If you found any error or want to help me to improve this article, please comment the pull request.\n","permalink":"https://tomasalmeida.pro/posts/2021/05/creating-an-archetype-from-project/","summary":"If you are creating a cloud of microservices or are in an environment where you have to generate multiple maven projects or modules, it is very useful to create archetypes to handle these new modules/projects creation.\nWhat is an archetype?

Check https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-inline to verify if a newer one is available when you read this article.\nUnit test Our unit tests for need to test both methods.\nCreating a test mocking a static method with no arguments @Test void shouldFinishConversation() { //given the object we want to test  PolitePerson politePerson = new PolitePerson(); // we use a try-with-resources block  try (MockedStatic\u0026lt;GreetingsUtil\u0026gt; greetingsUtilMockedStatic = mockStatic(GreetingsUtil.class)) { //given part: pay attention that inside the when we use a method reference  greetingsUtilMockedStatic.when(GreetingsUtil::sayFormalGoodbye).thenReturn(\u0026#34;Bye\u0026#34;); //when part: we call the part of the real code which uses the static method  final String goodbyeMessage = politePerson.finishConversation(); //then part: we verify our mocked method is called and the class does its part (in this case, adding the \u0026#34;!\u0026#34;)  assertEquals(\u0026#34;Bye!\u0026#34;, goodbyeMessage); } } Full code available in the example repo in github\nSome notes about the code above:\n We statically imported the method mockStatic (and others). The try-with-resources part is a bit verbose and forces us to create most of the code inside the try block. The mocked method uses a method reference, in the next example, we show how to change behavior based in the argument.  Creating a test mocking a static method with arguments @Test void shouldStartConversation() { //given the object we want to test  PolitePerson politePerson = new PolitePerson(); // we use a try-with-resources block  try (MockedStatic\u0026lt;GreetingsUtil\u0026gt; greetingsUtilMockedStatic = mockStatic(GreetingsUtil.class)) { //given part: pay attention that inside the when we verify the given argument is equals to \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;  greetingsUtilMockedStatic.when(() -\u0026gt; GreetingsUtil.getFormalHello(eq(\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;))).thenReturn(\u0026#34;Hello John\u0026#34;); //when part: we call the part of the real code which uses the static method  final String helloMessage = politePerson.startConversationWith(\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;); //then part: we verify our mocked method is called and the class does its part (in this case, adding the \u0026#34;!\u0026#34;)  assertEquals(\u0026#34;Hello John!\u0026#34;, helloMessage); } } Full code available in the example repo in github\nSome notes about the code above:\n We, again, statically imported the method mockStatic (and others). We use a lambda expression inside the when We are testing if the given argument to our static mocked test is equals to \u0026ldquo;John\u0026rdquo;  Bonus: Mocking constructors Some methods create new objects inside it and for tests, we could want to control how these internal objects behave. For that, in Mockito 3.5.0+ you can also mock constructors.\n@Test void shouldForceAnInformalPerson() { // we use a try-with-resources block  try (MockedConstruction politePersonConstructionMocked = mockConstruction(PolitePerson.class)) { // given part: in our example, we create the new object, but this part could be inside a method call  PolitePerson mockedPolitePerson = new PolitePerson(); // given part: when the mock PolitePerson finish conversation is called, an informal goodbye is sent  when(mockedPolitePerson.finishConversation()).thenReturn(\u0026#34;Take it easy\u0026#34;); // when part: call the method  final String informalGoodbyeMessage = mockedPolitePerson.finishConversation(); // then part: we verify our fake message is returned and we verify the mock is called only once  assertEquals(\u0026#34;Take it easy\u0026#34;, informalGoodbyeMessage); verify(mockedPolitePerson, times(1)).finishConversation(); } } Full code available in the example repo in github\nSome notes about the code above:\n Given part: we also created the object here, but in the real world, the object creation is part of the \u0026ldquo;then\u0026rdquo; part. We use verify method from mockito to test the method is called only once. The times(1) is not needed for the value 1, but I prefer to put it explicitly to make the code more precise.

All needed information is there, but I will rephrase and detail some steps below.\nGithub tokens are a way to give permissions to other agents to access/act in your repositories without giving them your password.\nCreate a new github token   To generate a new token, go to your Settings (click in your avatar on the top right and then Settings) -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Developer settings\u0026rdquo; option -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Personal access tokens\u0026rdquo; option -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Generate new token\u0026rdquo; button.\n  Choose a name (I recommend something meaningful like travis-ci-token) and select repo checkbox (travis will commit changes for you).\n  Generate the token (button in the bottom) and store the value.  Set the github token in travis  Go to https://travis-ci.com/github/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io and in \u0026ldquo;more options\u0026rdquo; choose Settings. Add a new environment variable called GITHUB_TOKEN and insert the token value.  Ensure Display value in build log is unchecked. Optionally: you can restrict the access to branch main. Save it.
