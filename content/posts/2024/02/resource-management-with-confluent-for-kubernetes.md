## Article in Confluent Blog

My first article on Confluent Blog [How to Use Confluent for Kubernetes to Manage Resources Outside of Kubernetes](https://www.confluent.io/blog/resource-management-with-confluent-for-kubernetes/) talks about how to manage your Confluent resources like RBAC, topics, schemas and connectors using Kubernetes in Confluent components living outside Kubernetes.

The article is complemented with a full demo and I hope it can be an inspiration if you are familiar with Kubernetes and uses Confluent components in VM machines or similar.
