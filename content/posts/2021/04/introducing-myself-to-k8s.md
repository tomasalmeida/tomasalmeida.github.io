I am starting my journey with kubernetes (k8s) and I want to share the tutorials and blog posts that I read. In that way I can find them easily too ðŸ˜¬.

## Kubernetes basics:

1. [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Kubernetes](https://dzone.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-kubernetes): a very complete guide about the kubernetes basics and how they work internally.
2. [An introduction to Kubernetes.](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/kubernetes/): defines kubernetes, pod, deployment, service, ingress, job, kubernetes control plane and when to NOT use k8s.

## Kubernetes tools:
1. [Developer Tooling for Kubernetes in 2021: Helm, Kustomize, and Skaffold](https://dzone.com/articles/developer-tooling-for-kubernetes-in-2021-helm-kust). Important point here: kustomize is part of `kubectl` calling `kubectl -k`, so it will, possibly, become the standard.
2. [How To Manage Your Kubernetes Configurations with Kustomize](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-manage-your-kubernetes-configurations-with-kustomize)
3. [Expose Your App to The Internet Using Ingress Controller](https://dzone.com/articles/expose-your-app-to-the-internet-using-ingress-cont)
4. [kaniko - Build Images In Kubernetes](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko)

This list will grow, but if you found any error or want to help me to improve this article, please [comment the pull request](https://github.com/tomasalmeida/tomasalmeida.github.io/pull/4)
