Hello, I am Tom√°s.

I am a senior software engineer and team lead at Netcentric, I work as a bridge between the business necessities and the development team. My main tasks include participating in business meetings to guide the client about how to take advantage of Adobe products, supporting the team to work better, and designing and implementing solutions.

Before joining Netcentric, I worked at Optare Solutions (Spain) as Senior Consultant in the telecom industry. As a consultant, I was part of the client team as the specialist of Oracle OSM product. I discussed the design and implementation of the solution between client and other providers and was the first contact in case of incidents.

Besides these two companies, I also worked as software specialist at Motorola Devices (Brazil and USA), and intern at Capgemini Telecom & Media (France), CenPRA (Brazil) and Unicamp (Brazil).

In my spare time, I work on personal projects using and testing new technologies. I'm a computer engineer by Unicamp (Brazil), with 1.5 years of exchange (INSA - France) with a Brazilian scholarship.
